# Python Project - Analysis of the Iris Flower Dataset


# Summary/Description
The Python Project consists of an analysis of Ronald Fisher's Iris Flower Dataset. The dataset consists of 50 samples each of three different species of the Iris Flower (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, Iris Versicolor). There are 4 features/variables measured in cm of the Iris Flower (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width). Through visualization and analysis of these features we are able to distinguish each species of from each other.

### Change log

25/04/2020 - Created the project repository and downloaded a version of the Iris Flower Dataset to the repository. 
26/04/2020 - Updated the downloaded version of the dataset as the initial version didn't have the headers/attribute values. 
27/04/2020 - Started writing the README file of research conduction, change log and Project plan.
29/04/2020 – Had some issues with the link between the local repository and the GitHub repository which I couldn’t resolve so created a new repository and finally got the link working. Wrote some of the analysis.py code that creates the histograms and the scatter plots. For the scatter plots wasn’t sure whether the requirement was for completing the plots for the full sample or to complete plot by species. Divided the dataset into each species and completed plot which for each set of variables by each species of Iris Flower.

# Project Plan

25/04/2020 - Late getting to this project but have a week to research and complete the project. Start project research, create new GitHub Repository for the project and download the Iris Flower dataset in text format. 

26/04/2020 - Review the course videos on plots and read some supplementary material from Real Python and Pandas. Complete some examples in commander to refamiliarise myself with the libraries and the plot information. 
27/04/2020 - Continue researching the Iris Flower Dataset. Do up a template to be used for the README file. 
28/04/2020 - Conduct an analysis of the data. 
30/04/2020 - Complete the project to as high a standard as possible given the time constraints. Ensure all the files, code are up to date and committed to GitHub. Ensure README has been completed and submit the project.
